{"name":"Gookie","tagline":"Lightweight, configurable GitHub webhook server.","body":"Gookie\r\n======\r\n\r\nSmall and highly configurable node server for handling your [GitHub Webhooks](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/).\r\n\r\nInspired by [GitHub Auto Deploy](https://github.com/logsol/Github-Auto-Deploy) which was written in Python and designed only for pull requests. GitHub Webhook Server is written in Node.js and is just as friendly; outputs deploy script output; and is more configurable. Was designed to solve one or two of the problems we ran into at the [eth0 hackathon](https://github.com/hoxxep/eth0-Hackathon), such as mentioning in the terminal that a ping event occurred and showing errors during git pull/our deploy script.\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n1. Download Gookie or clone the repo (`git clone https://github.com/hoxxep/Gookie`).\r\n2. Edit `config.json` by setting the port for your webhook and configuring a repository.\r\n3. Run `npm install` to install local dependencies.\r\n4. Run `node Gookie.js` to start the server.\r\n5. Test your Gookie server is running by visiting your ip:port in a browser.\r\n    - *Troubleshooting:* you may have to open ports if your router/firewall is restricting your chosen port. You can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) as a temporary solution.\r\n6. Configure your [webhook](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/) by visiting your repo settings on GitHub.\r\n    - Enter the url of your machine and the port, and specify content type as application/json.\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nExample `config.json`:\r\n\r\n```JSON\r\n{\r\n  \"port\": 8001,\r\n  \"repositories\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"url\": \"https://github.com/hoxxep/Gookie\",\r\n      \"path\": \"~/Documents/Projects/Gookie\",\r\n      \"deploy\": \"sh pull-and-build.sh\"\r\n    }, {\r\n      \"url\": \"https://github.com/hoxxep/Snarl\",\r\n      \"path\": \"~/Documents/Projects/Snarl\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf left blank, the `port` will default to 8001; and any repository options/properties which have been left out default to the following:\r\n\r\n```JSON\r\n{\r\n  \"url\": \"https://github.com/hoxxep/Gookie\",\r\n  \"path\": \"~/Documents/Projects/Gookie\",\r\n  \"deploy\": \"git pull\",\r\n  \"secret\": \"\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means if you don't have a custom `deploy` script/command, it will default to `git pull`, and the secret will default to blank.\r\n\r\nTODOs\r\n-----\r\n\r\n- Include support for multiple webhooks on the same repo and different actions for each\r\n- Quiet mode\r\n- Add a custom terminal message for ping event\r\n- Stop server sending errors to client\r\n- Add support for repo/webhook secret\r\n- Better parsing of github url (currently must have 'https://', no trailing slash and no www)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCreated by Liam Gray (@hoxxep).\r\nReleased under the MIT License.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
