GitHub Webhook Server
=====================

Small and highly configurable node server for handling your GitHub Webhooks.
Inspired by [GitHub Auto Deploy](https://github.com/logsol/Github-Auto-Deploy) which was written in Python and designed only for pull requests. GitHub Webhook Server is written in Node.js and is just as friendly; outputs deploy script output; and is more configurable. Was designed to solve one or two of the problems we ran into at the eth0 hackathon, such as mentioning in the terminal that a ping event occurred and showing errors during git pull/our deploy script.
